INDICES
- period 	t = 1, ..., s 
- product	i = 1, ..., n
- source 	j = 1, ..., m


VARIABLES
1st stage variables
- x_i_t		production of product i at time t					(associated cost: c^1_i_t)
- u_j_t		additional capacity of source j at time t			(associated cost: c^2_j_t)
- z+_t-1_t	planned increase of work force from t-1 to t		(associated cost: c^3+_t-1_t)
- z-_t-1_t	planned decrease of work force from t-1 to t		(associated cost: c^3-_t-1_t)

2nd stage variables
- y+_i_t	shortage of product i at the end of time t			(associated cost: q+_i_t)
- y-_i_t	surplus of product i at the end of time t			(associated cost: q-_i_t)

random variables
- \xi_i_t	demand of product i at time t
